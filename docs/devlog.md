## Stage 1 — Execution Time Profiling

Built a basic execution-time profiler using a Python decorator and `time.perf_counter()`.

Key things learned:
- decorators replace function references
- wrappers delay execution until runtime
- difference between decoration time and execution time

Issues faced:
- Python import/package structure issues
- fixed using `__init__.py`
